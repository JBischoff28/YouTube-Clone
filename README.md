# YouTube-Clone Project

### Final Guided Project
This project is the final instructor guided project for devCodeCamp. The code is all orginal and self developed, though instruction was provided and user stories were set by course instructors.

### Third-Party APIs
This project introduced students to the use of third-party APIs. This is the project that taught me how to use open sourse APIs, such as the YouTube Data API, to create applications with large databases.

### JWT
The YouTube-Clone project also introduced me to user authentication. In this course, I was taught how to authenticate users using Json Web Tokens. I found this very valuable since the majority of modern web applications now use authentication.
